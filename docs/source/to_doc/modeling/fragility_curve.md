# - Fragility Curve

A fragility curve is a common tool used in hydrology and seismic studies for risk assessment. It shows how vulnerable a system or structure is to a particular hazard. Fragility curves are developed through data analysis of historical events, simulation and statistical methods.

In the context of power grids, fragility curves are employed to measure the resiliency of grid elements.
