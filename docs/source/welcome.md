# Welcome to reXplan!

**Power systems** have traditionally been designed and operated to **ensure reliable supply of electricity** to customers, with a focus on minimizing the frequency and duration of outages.<br>
In recent years, there has been a growing recognition that power systems are also **vulnerable to disruptions, such as climate driven extreme weather events**, physical- and cyber-attacks.<br>
Therefore, the concept of **resilience** has become **increasingly important** in the design and operation of power systems.

But what is **"resilience in power systems"** ?

> <i>"**Power system resilience** is the ability to **limit** the **extent**, **system impact**, and **duration of degradation** in order to **sustain critical services following an extraordinary event**."</i>

<h4>A Novel Tool for the Analysis of Climate Resilience in Power Systems</h4>

In response to the need for more resilient power grids, the **R&D team of the Energy Systems Consulting department of Tractebel Engineering GmbH** has developed reXplan - a Python Package with [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/FirasJrad/reXplan) and **capabilites to simulate and analyse resilience of power grids**. This information can **help with the decision making progress** for grid operators, policymakers, response agencies, energy consumers and investors.

<h4>How does reXplan work?</h4>

The Python Package reXplan... #TODO
The repository primarily utilizes [**Jupyter Notebook**](https://jupyter.org/). Having the advantage to not only execute the code, but also **structure the code into cells** and to provide context with narrative text, reXplan can be easily learned and used. Everything that needs to be accessed by the [**Jupyter Notebook**](https://jupyter.org/) is already stored in the resiliencyTool Module. An extensive Documentation of how to import the module correctly is provided under [Basic Example](/to_doc/gettingstarted/jup_basic_example.ipynb#Step-1:-Library-and-Data-Import).<br><br> Prior experience in Python is advantageous.
General information can be found at [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/).
