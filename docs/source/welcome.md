# Welcome to reXplan!

**Power systems** have traditionally been designed and operated to **ensure reliable supply of electricity** to customers, with a focus on minimizing the frequency and duration of outages.<br>
In recent years, there has been a growing recognition that power systems are also **vulnerable to disruptions, such as climate driven extreme weather events**, physical- and cyber-attacks.<br>
Therefore, the concept of **resilience** has become **increasingly important** in the design and operation of power systems.

But what is **"resilience in power systems"** ?

> <i>"**Power system resilience** is the ability to **limit** the **extent**, **system impact**, and **duration of degradation** in order to **sustain critical services following an extraordinary event**."</i>

### A Novel Tool for the Analysis of Climate Resilience in Power Systems

In response to the need for more resilient power grids, the **R&D team of the Energy Systems Consulting department of Tractebel Engineering GmbH** has developed reXplan - a python package with [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/Tractebel-TEG/reXplan-repo) and **capabilites to simulate and analyse resilience of power grids**. This information can **help with the decision making progress** for grid operators, policymakers, response agencies, energy consumers and investors.

### How does reXplan work?

The repository utilizes [**Jupyter**](https://jupyter.org/) and [**Pluto**](https://plutojl.org/) notebooks. Having the advantage to not only execute the code, but also **structure the code into cells** and to provide context with narrative text, reXplan can be easily learned and used. Everything that needs to be accessed by the notebooks is already stored in the reXplan module. An extensive documentation of how to import the module correctly is provided under [Basic Example](/to_doc/gettingstarted/basic_example_sphinx.ipynb#Step-1:-Library-and-Data-Import).<br><br> Prior experience in Python and Julia is advantageous.
General information can be found at [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/) and [https://julialang.org/](https://julialang.org/).
